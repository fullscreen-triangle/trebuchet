# Rust Microservices - High Performance CLI microservice platform 

I already have around 20 python and reactjsx (nextjs) projects that I want to start managing with a powerful language to replace bottlenecks in python and react. My projects involve a very large number of calculations and machine learning (dask, ray, torch, opencv, threejs) and heavy use of AI models via api and local chat models and RAG systems. I also tried writing a python cli interface but its not in anyway powerful. Its supposed to assistant with orchestrating tasks using metacognitive models and specialised models for error handling (it reads and explains errors and can read code and modify it or create it from scratch). Most systems involve backends and frontends orchestrated by AI models.

Below is some examples of how I might use rust and you should take this as an example. I am going to place all the project descriptions in the docs folder, and expect you to read them and come up with a more well thoughtout  and structured document. 

I have zero experience in Rust and would want to learn by doing, implementing each module and understanding what its doing whilst building something. 


1. Rust’s zero-cost abstractions give you C-like throughput and tiny memory footprints, so this micro-service can replace a Python bottleneck and cut latency by ×5-×20.Scope: small enough (one binary) that you can finish in a week, but interesting enough to exercise async I/O, FFI and testing. | • Ownership / borrowing in practice (no segfaults)• tokio async runtime + channels• Writing ergonomically with clap/structopt• Exposing a REST/GRPC endpoint with axum or tonic• Interop with Python via pyo3 or JSON over stdin/stdout
Write a WASM plugin for your Next.js front-end that does client-side number-crunching (e.g. stride-parameter visualisation) | Real gain: moves heavy math off the JS main thread → snappier UI, no extra backend calls.Scope: compile Rust → WebAssembly with wasm-bindgen, ship as an npm package. | • Cargo → wasm-pack workflow• Exposing Rust functions to JS• SIMD & multithreaded WASM (Web Workers)• Debugging in browser DevTools
Create a data-parsing kernel in Rust, then call it from Python/Ray using FFI | Real gain: parsing big mzML / GPX / FIT files 10-50× faster than pure Python, freeing CPU time and RAM.Scope: one crate with serde + nom parsers, exported via pyo3 or cxx, unit-tested against your current fixtures. | • Zero-copy slices & lifetimes• Error handling with thiserror• Benchmarks with criterion• Publishing wheels with maturin
Spin up a Tauri desktop app as a lightweight “Coach Dashboard” | Real gain: cross-platform GUI (native window, 10 MB) driven by Rust backend, React/TS frontend. Great for coaches who can’t run full stack locally.Scope: CRUD over your pipeline’s REST API plus local CSV/video viewer. | • Event bus between Rust core & React• Filesystem access & OS notifications• Packaging and auto-updates
Write a domain-specific config validator for your JSON/YAML pipeline files | Real gain: catches mis-config before a multi-hour GPU run starts.Scope: CLI that loads stages.json, validates against a Rust schemars schema and extra semantic rules. Instant payoff every time someone tweaks configs. | • Enums / pattern-matching• Macro-powered JSON schema generation• Rich errors with miette
